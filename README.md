# Description

Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm is a markov chain based approach
that provides a way to generate samples from a distribution from which
direct sampling is difficult. It does this by simulating samples from a
different distribution from which direct sampling is easier and
accepting those samples with a probability. We will build a R package
that implements the M-H algorithm. Our package offers support for
univariate and multivariate sampling using the M-H algorithm.

## Installation

You can install the development version of RMetropolisHastings from
[GitHub](https://github.com/rtiwari6-stats/RMetropolisHastings) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rtiwari6-stats/RMetropolisHastings")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
##library(RMetropolisHastings)
## basic example code
```
